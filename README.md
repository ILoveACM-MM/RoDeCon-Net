<h1> RoDeCon-Net: Medical Image Segmentation via Robust Decoupling and Contrast-Enhanced Fusion </h1>
</div>

## 🎈 News

- [2025.2.19] Training and inference code released

## ⭐ Abstract

Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical decision-making, treatment planning, and disease tracking. Nonetheless, it confronts two significant challenges: the presence of "soft boundaries" between the foreground and background exacerbated by poor illumination and low contrast, and the misleading co-occurrence of salient and non-salient objects during the training phase, which complicates the model's accuracy in distinguishing relevant features. To overcome these challenges, we introduce RoDeCon-Net, a novel framework engineered to enhance medical image segmentation. RoDeCon-Net incorporates a Feature Decoupling Unit (FDU) that dynamically separates encoded features into foreground, background, and uncertain regions, using advanced attention mechanisms to refine feature distinction and reduce uncertainty. Additionally, our Contrast-driven Feature Alignment Unit (CFAU) and Cross-layer Feature Cascade Unit (CFCU) synergize to reinforce feature contrasts and promote effective multi-level feature fusion, thus improving the detection of salient objects amidst complex backgrounds and handling various object scales within images. Comprehensive evaluations of RoDeCon-Net on five diverse medical image datasets validate its superior performance and versatility, showcasing its potential to set new benchmarks in medical image segmentation.

The challenges: (a) the effects of fuzzy edges (soft boundaries). (b) The misleading co-occurrence of salient and non-salient objects.
